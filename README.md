# Practical-Deep-Learning
From beginner to implementing state-of-art Research.

THIS REPO CONTAINS ENOUGH DETAILS FOR A BEGINNER TO GET UP AND RUNNING WITH DEEP LEARNING.TOWARDS THE END IT WILL TEACH HOW TO READ RESEARCH PAPERS AND IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN IDEAS.Note:(This material is used for teaching along side the author explaining the details....it may or may not be useful as a standalone resource)

**`Refresher`**

As an assignment:

* Take any image as input and give a zoomed image as output

* Use pivot point (where to zoom) and scale as parameters.

* Width and height needs to be same of input and output image.

The assignment.py contains the implementation.This assignment is used not just to teach some basic ideas in computer vision but also to explain some python internals.

Keras squeeze-excitation networks:
Towards the end of this notebook we will implement squeeze-excitation network but before that we will learn Transfer Learning and how to Structure Research Projects..
